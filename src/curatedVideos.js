                "title": "How to Stop Translating in Your Head and Start Thinking in English Like a Native",
                "description": "Think in English. Stop translating in your head and speak fluent, natural English without hesitation. In conversations and other situations where you need to be able to process information quickly and respond immediately, translating in your head is a big problem. It slows you down. It makes you hesitate. At times you’ll completely miss out on the conversation because your chance to jump in has come and gone and you’re still trying to translate.\n\nOn top of all that, a lot of slang, idioms and phrasal verbs can be difficult to translate quickly — if at all! It’s really best for your fluency if you stop translating in your head and learn to start thinking in English.\n\nThinking in English is very important to developing your fluency in English… so let’s go! Here are my nine tips for thinking in English.\n\nDO DAILY ACTIVITIES IN ENGLISH\nCan you change your phone settings to English? How about talking to your pet in English when you’re going for a walk? If you commute to work by train or bus could you buy your fare in English?\n\nLISTEN TO MORE ENGLISH FOR IMMERSION WITH NATIVE SPEAKERS\nTurn on the internet radio, download podcasts, put Netflix or YouTube on in the background while you’re doing your chores or work!\n\nYour brain is so amazing that it will begin to recognize patterns and want to follow them too!\n\nTRY GUESSING OR PLANNING WHAT ENGLISH SPEAKERS ARE GOING TO SAY\nWhen you predict the conversation based on experience, you’ll be more confident and ready to respond.\n\nImagine the conversations that you want to have in the future and create them before they happen so you feel more prepared. It may not go word-for-word how you plan it, so be ready for change. You could write the conversation down and practice it a few times.\n\nSTOP LEARNING EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH TRANSLATION\nObserve, watch, hear, smell and relate vocabulary directly to its meaning — not the word in your first language.\n\nUSE A MONOLINGUAL DICTIONARY\nA bilingual dictionary is good for one thing — to put your coffee cup on so it doesn’t leave rings on your table.\n\nLABEL OBJECTS IN YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE IN ENGLISH\nYou can do this in your mind or actually on pieces of paper taped to the objects (or use sticky notes). Start with everyday objects that you use every day! For example, if I have a book at home and I am learning Portuguese I would label it “livro,” or if I am learning Arabic then I would label it “kitab.” Every time I look at it I am reminded to think that word!\n\nTALK TO YOURSELF IN ENGLISH\nAsk yourself questions and answer them.\n\nMake up a short story about a person you see on your way to work.\n\nYou may want to do this in private when no one else is within earshot. It’s ok if you are not sure if your grammar is perfect, or if you make a mistake. No one will know! If you’re not sure if what you said to yourself is correct or not, then make a note to yourself to find out! You can do some research online, or ask your teacher or a native speaker friend later.\n\nJUST START THINKING IN ENGLISH WITH A MANTRA\nEven the smallest effort is better than nothing. Start with a mantra, or motto, that will help you get started each day in English. For example, “My English is getting better each day.”\n\nTHINK A LITTLE MORE IN ENGLISH EACH DAY\nStart small. Make it a habit to think in English a little each day. Set an alarm if it’s hard to remember to switch into English. Then use the timer on your phone or computer to 1 minute to start and think only in English for that amount of time. It doesn’t matter what you think about, or even if you just say a few of the same phrases over and over. See if you can extend the time each day by 30 seconds!\n\nEnglish speaking tips: this playlist includes tons of great advice for speaking English more fluently and confidently!

Cognitive scientist Lera Boroditsky shares examples of language -- from an Aboriginal community in Australia that uses cardinal directions instead of left and right to the multiple words for blue in Russian -- that suggest the answer is a resounding yes. \"The beauty of linguistic diversity is that it reveals to us just how ingenious and how flexible the human mind is,\" Boroditsky says. \"Human minds have invented not one cognitive universe, but 7,000.\"\n\nCheck out more TED Talks: http://www.ted.com\n\nThe TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

                "description": "Author and speaker Tom Asacker wondered why so many people watch TED talks and yet so few change their behaviors as a result. His answer? That only one of three elements of our irrational, but innately human, decision-making process truly makes for lasting change. Learn more about Tom Asacker at http://tomasacker.com and TEDxCambridge at http://www.tedxcambridge.com.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.",

Dr. Lani Nelson-Zlupko is the founder of LNZ Consulting and an Adjunct Associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania. She received her bachelor's degree from Harvard University and her master's and doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania. Lani is a solution-oriented therapist, consultant and researcher who specializes in transition management. Her treatment strategies have become a training model for mental health professionals across the country. Her research has been published in several leading psychiatric and social work journals. In addition to mental health counseling for individuals, couples, and families, Lani provides coaching and training to individuals and corporations regionally and nationally.

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

Her inventions -- designed to chop vegetables, cut hair, apply lipstick and more -- rarely (if ever) succeed, and that's the point. \"The true beauty of making useless things [is] this acknowledgment that you don't always know what the best answer is,\" Giertz says. \"It turns off that voice in your head that tells you that you know exactly how the world works. Maybe a toothbrush helmet isn't the answer, but at least you're asking the question.\"\n\nCheck out more TED Talks: http://www.ted.com\n\nThe TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

Connecting Personality Type to The Laws of Attraction positions you for immediate manifestation of your desires while unleashing your preordained purpose. Your Creator gave you a unique Personality Type for a reason.\n\nThere are many words that describe Dr. D Ivan Young, but here are the few that I chose – discerning, enlightened, a spiritual teacher and sagacious philosopher. Seldom does someone possess the ability to connect, at a core level, to impact so many different and varying people. His witty insight into how, and moreover why, people do the things they do is astonishing. Having known Dr. Young for a few years, never have I seen him at a loss for words or searching for an answer. His compassion, his love, and his authentic way of communicating to us exactly what we need to hear and when we need to hear it has profoundly changed my life, and the lives of everyone I’ve witnessed him come in contact with.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

He was the all-star 20th-century designer of the Coca-Cola fountain and Lucky Strike pack; the modern sports car, locomotive, Greyhound bus and tractor; the interior of the first NASA spaceship; and the egg-shaped pencil sharpener. How did one man understand what consumers wanted from so many different areas of life? His grand theory of popularity was called MAYA: Most advanced yet acceptable. He said humans are torn between two opposing forces: neophilia, a love of new things; and neophobia; a fear of anything that’s too new. Hits, he said, live at the perfect intersection of novelty and familiarity. They are familiar surprises. In this talk, I’ll explain how Loewy’s theory has been validated by hundreds of years of research — and how we can all use it to make hits.  Derek Thompson is a senior editor at The Atlantic, where he writes about economics, technology and media. He is a news analyst with NPR's afternoon show “Here and Now,\" appearing weekly on Mondays, and an on-air contributor to CBS News. The recipient of several honors, including the 2016 Best in Business award for Columns and Commentary from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers, he is the author of the national bestselling book Hit Makers: How to Succeed in an Age of Distraction. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

                "title": "Pop Music is Stuck on Repeat | Colin Morris | TEDxPenn",
                "description": "Using foundational computer science theories, Colin Morris focuses on understanding trends in popular music. Borrowing from the areas of bioinformatics and compression algorithms, he shows that the lyrics of pop songs have become substantially more repetitive over the decades. Having established that, Morris tries to convince listeners that this is actually a good thing. He traces repetition in pop lyrics back to its poetic roots, and shows that, rather than being formulaic and recycled, repetitive songs show fascinating diversity. He suggests listeners stop thinking about repetitive earworms as guilty pleasures, and instead think of them as virtuous ones. Colin Morris is a data scientist and educator based in Toronto with a Master's in Computational Linguistics. His work often involves applying computational techniques to the analysis and appreciation of popular music. Most recently, he has analyzed trends in lyrical repetition of hit songs.

                "title": "How to Stop Translating in Your Head and Start Thinking in English Like a Native",
                "description": "Think in English. Stop translating in your head and speak fluent, natural English without hesitation. In conversations and other situations where you need to be able to process information quickly and respond immediately, translating in your head is a big problem. It slows you down. It makes you hesitate. At times you’ll completely miss out on the conversation because your chance to jump in has come and gone and you’re still trying to translate.\n\nOn top of all that, a lot of slang, idioms and phrasal verbs can be difficult to translate quickly — if at all! It’s really best for your fluency if you stop translating in your head and learn to start thinking in English.\n\nThinking in English is very important to developing your fluency in English… so let’s go! Here are my nine tips for thinking in English.\n\nDO DAILY ACTIVITIES IN ENGLISH\nCan you change your phone settings to English? How about talking to your pet in English when you’re going for a walk? If you commute to work by train or bus could you buy your fare in English?\n\nLISTEN TO MORE ENGLISH FOR IMMERSION WITH NATIVE SPEAKERS\nTurn on the internet radio, download podcasts, put Netflix or YouTube on in the background while you’re doing your chores or work!\n\nYour brain is so amazing that it will begin to recognize patterns and want to follow them too!\n\nTRY GUESSING OR PLANNING WHAT ENGLISH SPEAKERS ARE GOING TO SAY\nWhen you predict the conversation based on experience, you’ll be more confident and ready to respond.\n\nImagine the conversations that you want to have in the future and create them before they happen so you feel more prepared. It may not go word-for-word how you plan it, so be ready for change. You could write the conversation down and practice it a few times.\n\nSTOP LEARNING EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH TRANSLATION\nObserve, watch, hear, smell and relate vocabulary directly to its meaning — not the word in your first language.\n\nUSE A MONOLINGUAL DICTIONARY\nA bilingual dictionary is good for one thing — to put your coffee cup on so it doesn’t leave rings on your table.\n\nLABEL OBJECTS IN YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE IN ENGLISH\nYou can do this in your mind or actually on pieces of paper taped to the objects (or use sticky notes). Start with everyday objects that you use every day! For example, if I have a book at home and I am learning Portuguese I would label it “livro,” or if I am learning Arabic then I would label it “kitab.” Every time I look at it I am reminded to think that word!\n\nTALK TO YOURSELF IN ENGLISH\nAsk yourself questions and answer them.\n\nMake up a short story about a person you see on your way to work.\n\nYou may want to do this in private when no one else is within earshot. It’s ok if you are not sure if your grammar is perfect, or if you make a mistake. No one will know! If you’re not sure if what you said to yourself is correct or not, then make a note to yourself to find out! You can do some research online, or ask your teacher or a native speaker friend later.\n\nJUST START THINKING IN ENGLISH WITH A MANTRA\nEven the smallest effort is better than nothing. Start with a mantra, or motto, that will help you get started each day in English. For example, “My English is getting better each day.”\n\nTHINK A LITTLE MORE IN ENGLISH EACH DAY\nStart small. Make it a habit to think in English a little each day. Set an alarm if it’s hard to remember to switch into English. Then use the timer on your phone or computer to 1 minute to start and think only in English for that amount of time. It doesn’t matter what you think about, or even if you just say a few of the same phrases over and over. See if you can extend the time each day by 30 seconds!\n\nEnglish speaking tips: this playlist includes tons of great advice for speaking English more fluently and confidently! Watch it and quickly improve your skills: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehZiyJOLSts&list=PLDmyXXns94k1dtoY4fL_Eg3Fy0oQMu1Ln\n\nDON'T stay this!

Maybe a toothbrush helmet isn't the answer, but at least you're asking the question.\"\n\nCheck out more TED Talks: http://www.ted.com\n\nThe TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

                "description": "The \"Laws of Attraction\" are real; inasmuch, there is a Divine Component. Connecting Personality Type to The Laws of Attraction positions you for immediate manifestation of your desires while unleashing your preordained purpose. Your Creator gave you a unique Personality Type for a reason.\n\nThere are many words that describe Dr. D Ivan Young, but here are the few that I chose – discerning, enlightened, a spiritual teacher and sagacious philosopher. Seldom does someone possess the ability to connect, at a core level, to impact so many different and varying people. His witty insight into how, and moreover why, people do the things they do is astonishing. Having known Dr. Young for a few years, never have I seen him at a loss for words or searching for an answer. His compassion, his love, and his authentic way of communicating to us exactly what we need to hear and when we need to hear it has profoundly changed my life, and the lives of everyone I’ve witnessed him come in contact with.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

                "description": "Why do we like what we like? Raymond Loewy, the father of industrial design, had a theory. He was the all-star 20th-century designer of the Coca-Cola fountain and Lucky Strike pack; the modern sports car, locomotive, Greyhound bus and tractor; the interior of the first NASA spaceship; and the egg-shaped pencil sharpener. How did one man understand what consumers wanted from so many different areas of life? His grand theory of popularity was called MAYA: Most advanced yet acceptable. He said humans are torn between two opposing forces: neophilia, a love of new things; and neophobia; a fear of anything that’s too new. Hits, he said, live at the perfect intersection of novelty and familiarity. They are familiar surprises. In this talk, I’ll explain how Loewy’s theory has been validated by hundreds of years of research — and how we can all use it to make hits.  Derek Thompson is a senior editor at The Atlantic, where he writes about economics, technology and media. He is a news analyst with NPR's afternoon show “Here and Now,\" appearing weekly on Mondays, and an on-air contributor to CBS News. The recipient of several honors, including the 2016 Best in Business award for Columns and Commentary from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers, he is the author of the national bestselling book Hit Makers: How to Succeed in an Age of Distraction.

                "description": "Using foundational computer science theories, Colin Morris focuses on understanding trends in popular music. Borrowing from the areas of bioinformatics and compression algorithms, he shows that the lyrics of pop songs have become substantially more repetitive over the decades. Having established that, Morris tries to convince listeners that this is actually a good thing. He traces repetition in pop lyrics back to its poetic roots, and shows that, rather than being formulaic and recycled, repetitive songs show fascinating diversity. He suggests listeners stop thinking about repetitive earworms as guilty pleasures, and instead think of them as virtuous ones. Colin Morris is a data scientist and educator based in Toronto with a Master's in Computational Linguistics. His work often involves applying computational techniques to the analysis and appreciation of popular music. Most recently, he has analyzed trends in lyrical repetition of hit songs. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

Relaxation music can also be used as Spa music and Massage music. Here you can find powerful self-help hypnosis including healing music, Zen music and yoga music. Some sessions are produced for your inner transformation: to overcome fear, elevate your mood and energy levels, and lose weight faster. Meditation music recordings also include reiki music, Zen meditation music and deep trance hypnosis sessions.\nWe compose instrumental and electronic music that is specially designed to enhance brain function and concentration, spa and massage therapy, and healing music therapy. For this reason, we use binaural beats. There are many types of beats for different daily meditation purposes: Delta Waves – Sleep Music / NREM sleep, Alpha Waves are neural oscillations, Theta Waves (Cortical theta rhythm and Hippocampal theta rhythm). Beta waves associated with muscle contractions in isotonic movements, Gamma waves can help to release serotonin, endorphin and dopamine, so it works as happiness music for depression treatment.  \n* Sleep Music – Insomnia Music:\nGreenred Productions deep sleep music sessions have been specifically created to relax mind and body physically and mentally. Brainwave sessions are suitable for everyone including babies, children, and adults. Sleep hypnosis is based on beautifully slow, soft, soothing music to help you to fall asleep within minutes, naturally and without the aid of medication. These sleep meditation sessions will put you into relaxing healing sleep and will train your mind to fall asleep effortlessly. \nRelaxing sounds of nature combined with soothing music offers you a peaceful sleep. Would you like to learn to control your dreams, overcome nightmares? Lucid dream meditation sessions will help you to get into a deep state of relaxation and have a more pleasant sleep. Say no to sleep insomnia! Lucid Dreaming and Astral Travel music episodes are the most popular. \n* Study Music and Focus Music:\nStudy Music & Concentration Music is brainwave background music to help you to study, focus, and concentrate on learning process and work more effectively. Alpha Waves help your mind to get to the state of focus, which is perfect for studying or preparing for exam or test you have at school or university. It also maintains your alertness while studying. Beta waves will help to concentrate for tasks, enhance intelligence.\n- Google+\nhttps://goo.gl/xTqwhX\n- FACEBOOK\nhttps://goo.gl/FfNFoa\n- Twitter\nhttps://goo.gl/BmEf8o\n- Our website\nhttps://goo.gl/SWuQNw",
